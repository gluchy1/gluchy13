## Hi, I'm Michal!
I'm Computer Science Student at PJATK fascinated by AI research and implementing physics into python.  
Currently looking forward into MOJOlang development!

## Skills
// Python {Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, sci-kit, pymunk, pygame}  
// Java {object programming, GUI}  
// Microsoft Azure  
// Bash  

---

## Projects
// Basic subatomic particles simulation  
A very simple Python project made in PyGame and Pymunk that aims to simulate the behavior of basic subatomic particles by focusing on modeling the interactions and movements of particles with an option to modify gravitational and electrostatic constants. Implemented some of physics required for more realistic output, such as Boltzmann distribution.
